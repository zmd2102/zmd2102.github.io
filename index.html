            <p>My name is Zaid and I want to learn how to code. I graduated from school in 2017 with a degree in Economics and currently work at a bank in midtown called Jefferies.</p>
            <p>I love hiking and nature in general. Recently, I took a week off from work to visit the Shenendoah Mountains and Great Smoky Smoky National Park.</p>
            <p>I did an 11 mile hike and when i got to the summit, it was absolutely beautful. I can't wait to do it again.</p>
